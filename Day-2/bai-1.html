    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>
        This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous
            vide</em>
        cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is aprecisele set to the
        target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking fir Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter
        describes ir as " ultra-low temperature poaching".

        Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>.To reserve a seat ar the
        chef
        table, contact us before November 30.
